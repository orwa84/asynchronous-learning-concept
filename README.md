# Proposal and Description of a New Type of an Asynchronous Learning Platform

This is a description of an _asynchronous learning architecture and a product_ that I am proposing to lead the development of (and own shares in) at _Wild Code School_ and/or in its parent group.

## The Problem

In adult classrooms and technology bootcamps, people gather from different cultural, educational, and personal backgrounds to learn engaged topics that the academic educational system takes much longer to teach to students (on the order of 20-40 times as much). 

Often, the problem of _differentiation in the classroom_ is multipled this demanding environment. This is due to the many ways in which some students may gain an advantage over others in the area of learning a logical language.

### Logical languages

In a _logical language_ like Javascript, different symbols and character sequences, such as `[` and `??`, have a precise, real and an undisputable meaning. For example, not only that a space between the two question marks would imply something different than previously, it would also be considered "broken speech", or in logical-language terms, lead to a _syntax error_.

In the world of logical languages, the "receiver" of a logical language cannot recover from a _syntax error_ and hence must reject the speech entirely, in that case. This is due to the way logical languages are designed, which is namely, to be as accurate and as unambiguous as possible.

### Natural languages

On the other hand, the "meaning" in natural languages is constantly evolved and negotiated between two entitites who are constantly trying to guess and predict what the other entity is actually referring to in the real world.

In this realm, communication can continue to occur even when it is actually broken, namely, even when the two entities' prediction of what the other entity is referring to, is far off from what it actually is. 

### The logical advantage

The main way in which, arguably, the biggest _differentiation gap_ is created in technology bootcamps is in students' apptitude for manufacturing, and consuming, logical languages.

For example, social workers, housewives, communication professionals and many others, might need considerably more preparation, even to begin learning something like Javascript.

Namely, this category of people might have to go through a lot of ["visual"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_word_form_area) training just to be able to:

- Discern the presence of spaces around words and operators[^1]
- Discern the difference between punctuation marks that are otherwise similar, or do not have a special meaning in the writing systems of most natural languages[^2]
- The inability or the great effort required to match openers with closers (i.e. brackets and other symmetrical pairs of characters), and/or the level of difficulty involved in discerning the _hierarchy and structure_ of logical speech[^3]
- Failing to discern the hierarchy and structure of a logical expression (from the previous point) can also make it very challenging for individuals in this category to look at a relatively-simple, but a _domain-specific_ logical language, such as _mermaid_ (a logical language for creating diagrams) and draw a _correspondence_ between the mermaid description of the state diagram and the state diagram itself, even when laid right next to each other.
- The inability or the great effort required to discern the embeddings of one logical language into another[^4]

[^1]: For example, the inability to naturally distinguish between the presence and the lack of spaces before commas in writing, and the inability to be consistent with the preservation or the elimination of such spaces, is a common observation amongst this category of people.
[^2]: For example, confusing parantheses `(` with square brackets `[` and/or using them interchangeably in a Javascript program. Being surprised to learn the completely different meaning these have also falls in the same category, but also continuing to fail or encounter difficulty using the right one after being briefed.
[^3]: For example, failing to discern the end of a statement and the beginning of another. Also, finding difficulty identifying the point in the code where stuff inside of a function should go, or the point in the code where the _condition part_ of an `if` statement is ought to be placed.
[^4]: For example, the embedding of JSX inside of Javascript, and the consequential "switch" in grammer rules resulting from such  an embedding. This becomes even more challenging, as the JSX notation provides its own way of "switch back" to the Javascript context, right from within of the JSX context itself ðŸ¤¯. It is my theory, that since natural languages offer only two levels of embedding at best, that our brains are not naturally skilled at keeping track of these many levels of embeddings without special training. Hence it makes sense why people coming from natural languages might find discerning the structure of such convoluted logical speech very challenging.
